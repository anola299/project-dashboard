Project Name: Project Performance Analysis Dashboard

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

This project aims to analyze performance trends using historical project data,
including parameters such as Project Name, Type, Manager, Cost, Benefit,
Complexity, Status, and Completion Percentage. An interactive dashboard, developed
with Streamlit or Dash, will provide real-time insights into key performance indicators
(KPIs) to improve project tracking, risk management, and decision-making. Data
processing and cleaning will be done using Pandas to compute performance metrics,
handle missing values, and transform date formats. The dashboard will generate
insights on project completion rates, budget deviations, and deadline adherence,
using various visualizations such as Gantt charts for timeline tracking, line graphs for
budget trends, and heatmaps and bar charts to illustrate project complexity and
completion status. By presenting data-driven insights, this tool will help stakeholders
make informed decisions, improve efficiency, and optimize project outcomes. It will
serve as a valuable resource for enhancing project management and strategic
planning.

SOLUTION:
1. Data processing and cleaning using Pandas (handling missing values,
transforming dates).
2. Interactive dashboard with real-time project performance insights.
3. Gantt charts for timeline visualization.
4. Line graphs for budget trends.
5. Heat maps and bar charts to analyze project complexity and completion
status.
6. Stakeholder-friendly interface for improved decision-making
